The "Pymaceuticals" jupyter notbook contains an analysis of different mice with tumors. There were different drug regimens included in the data. 

arious factors were taken into consideration including the timepoint, volume of the tumor, the sex of the mouse, age, and weight.

There were almost an equal amount of male and female mice tested in this study.

Looking at the final tumor comparisons, mice using Capomulin and Ramicane had the best results with the tumor size showing lower than the other drug regimens.

When looking at the average weight of each mouse treated with Capomulin, mice with a larger weight tend to have larger tumors. Overall, the tumors did reduce in size for the mice treated with this medicine.
